### Projects are how we learn

The only way to learn something is by doing it. I'm planning work on some projects in the new few months and in the process learn new skills. I want to use this notebook to write about them. This is mainly for me as reference but if I think it would be useful to a wider audience, I will convert some of these into blog posts.

### Plan

My current plan is to tackle roughly _one project per week_. One week is long enough to build something and get some initial learnings. But even if I end up disliking the project area, it was still only a week lost. But if I find it fun and useful, I'll add another week - and another milestone.

### Project list

- Week of Mar 26: [Teach a course on Skillshare](projects/skillshare.md)
